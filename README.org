* About
~imbot~ removes the hassle of switching input method back and forth.

* Install
Put the files on load-path, or install ~imbot~ from ~melpa~.

* Config
1. For Windows and Mac users, commands for input method toggle can be found at https://github.com/laishulu/emacs-smart-input-source
2. If your commands for input method toggle were not covered in the provided setups, please follow the imbot--im-config examples in imbot--fcitx5.el or imbot--ibus.el to make imbot work.
3. Make sure your input method remembers each application's last input state. For example, if you use fcitx5, you have to set the "Share Input Method" option to "No".
4. An example configuration using use-package:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(use-package imbot
    :hook
        (evil-mode . imbot-mode)
    :preface
        (setq imbot--im-config 'imbot--fcitx5))
#+END_SRC

* Advanced Usage for fcitx5 users
If you find pre command checker for input status is slow, the input status can be obtained with a lua script for fcitx5.
Please follow instructions below:

1. disable pre command check with (setq imbot--active-omit-check t)
2. put update_im_state.sh under ~/.local/bin/
3. put "addon" and "lua" under ~/.local/share/fcitx5/
4. the default input method toggle shortcut is Ctrl+\ , the hot key is set in state_monitor.lua
